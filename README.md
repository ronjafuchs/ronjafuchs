### Hey, I'm Ronja! 🙋🏻‍♀️


Currently I am studying Computer Science at Leibniz Universität Hannover. In my studies I have especially come to love all things software-engineering as well as data science! I graduated (BSc) in 2024 and am currently studying to get my Masters. It's exciting to be able to gain so much knowledge and be able to specialize more and more.
Also I am working as a student researcher at Leibniz Universität Hannover, Institute for Information Processing.

Before I worked on various projects in Frontend Development using Angular. While I do not count this to my daily work, I still love doing a project now and then. :)
