### Hey, I'm Ronja! 🙋🏻‍♀️

I'm currently working @ kraftwerk Kraft-Wärme-Kopplung GmbH doing machine learning for cogeneration units 🧡 

Before, I worked with Angular on diverse projects, so this has been quite a change in scenery for me! 🌅 

I'm happy to accept the challenge and take on the world of ML, currently learning so much about this whole new world. 🌍
